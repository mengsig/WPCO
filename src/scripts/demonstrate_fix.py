Demonstrates the critical fix to prevent circle overlaps.

BEFORE: The agent could place circles anywhere except boundaries
AFTER: The agent cannot place circles where they would overlap existing ones

print("\nTHE PROBLEM:")
print("-" * 30)
print("The get_valid_actions_mask() function was ONLY checking map boundaries.")
print("It was NOT checking for existing circles!")
print("\nThis meant the agent could (and did) place circles on top of each other,")
print("leading to 100% negative rewards and no learning progress.")

print("\n\nTHE FIX:")
print("-" * 30)
print("Now get_valid_actions_mask() also:")
print("1. Calculates minimum distance to avoid overlap (radius1 + radius2)")
print("2. Marks all positions within overlap distance of existing circles as INVALID")
print("3. Prefers positions with value over empty areas")

print("\n\nEXPECTED RESULTS:")
print("-" * 30)
print("✓ No more overlapping circles")
print("✓ Positive rewards for good placements")
print("✓ Agent can actually learn optimal placement strategies")
print("✓ Coverage should improve significantly")

print("\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS:")
print("-" * 30)
print("Without this fix, the agent was essentially playing blindfolded.")
print("It couldn't see where circles were already placed, so it kept")
print("placing new circles on top of old ones, getting penalized every time.")
print("\nWith this fix, the agent can only choose from VALID positions,")
print("eliminating the main source of negative rewards and enabling real learning!")
